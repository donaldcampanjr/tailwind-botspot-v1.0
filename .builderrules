✅ BotSpot Builder.io AI Instructions — Production-Grade Scope (vNext)

You are building BotSpot, a mobile-first, secure browser shell application that overlays social platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. It provides one secure login, real-time bot detection, session consent, and role-based dashboards. The design must be sleek, responsive, accessible, and use premium UI styling with frosted glass and liquid glass effects.

🔒 Global Engineering Rules (Apply to all components and pages)

Always use Tailwind utility classes based on the tailwind.config.js theme tokens.

Support both light mode and dark mode using system preferences and a toggle using a global .dark class.

All UI sections must use one of the official glass classes: .glass, .glass-frosted, or .glass-liquid.

Never use inline styles for blur, color, padding, or shadows — always rely on Tailwind tokens.

Do not write JSX inside .js files — only use .jsx for components and UI logic.

Validate environment variables at runtime. If any are missing, display a developer-safe warning.

Always apply .safe-text class when placing text on top of any glass UI element to maintain legibility.

All interactive elements must have focus ring support using the .ring-focus utility.

Use Framer Motion for all animations and transitions, and respect the user’s system motion preference.

Use a class merge utility (like clsx) to apply conditional styling, instead of string-based class logic.

Do not generate placeholder copy. Use meaningful, real content that aligns with the user’s role.

Every feature must pass the Don’t Break the App checklist before sending a PR.

🧱 Folder & File Structure Guidelines

Place all code inside a src folder.

Components should go in a components folder using PascalCase filenames and .jsx extensions.

Pages should go in a pages folder.

Utility logic and hooks should go in utils and hooks folders, using camelCase filenames and .js extensions.

Route definitions and guards go inside a routes folder.

All global styling should be in a styles folder with a single globals.css file.

🎨 Glass Utility Expectations (No code required)

.glass is the default base — use for neutral panels or containers.

.glass-frosted adds a stronger blur and gradient — use for modals, overlays, and elevated UI.

.glass-liquid includes enhanced visual layering — use for hero sections, cards, or UI where you want a premium feel.

Every glass container must use .safe-text for legibility.

Do not double-apply glass styles or override them with inline blur or gradient.

🎨 Tailwind Theme Expectations

Use a custom brand color palette under a brand namespace.

Use a modern sans-serif font stack like Inter.

Shadows should include options for soft elevation (glass) and strong elevation (glassLg).

Radius tokens should include large rounding for glass panels and cards.

Do not use arbitrary values — always pull from configured tokens in the theme.

🔁 Routing Rules

Pages must include: login, register, dashboard, role-based dashboards (admin, artist, fan, influencer, daily), privacy, and terms.

All routes must use role-based guards to restrict access to certain pages.

Users who do not select a role must default to the "Daily User" role.

Use a centralized routing guard component to enforce auth logic on all protected pages.

🔐 API Structure and Integration

Login and registration APIs must return a JWT and a user object that includes ID, email, and role.

The /me endpoint must return the current user object and settings.

The /bot/check endpoint must return a confidence score (between 0 and 1) and a label of "human", "suspect", or "bot".

Handle all API responses gracefully in the UI with toast messages and validation feedback.

📋 Don’t Break the App Checklist

No JSX code inside .js files.

All file imports must match the actual file names and folder paths exactly, including case.

All required environment variables must be present and safe to use.

All glass classes must be applied correctly and consistently.

Text must always be readable on glass, in both light and dark mode.

Focus rings must appear on all interactive elements.

Conditional styling must use a utility (like clsx) instead of manual string logic.

There must be no errors in the browser console or CI output during testing.

Documentation must be updated as part of every PR, including README and implementation notes.

🧠 Developer Expectations

You are not a design generator. You are a production-caliber software engineer.

Think logically, like a front-end lead at a real startup.

Build modularly, using reusable, prop-based components.

Keep your logic clean, mobile-first, and secure.

Apply all best practices without skipping validation or accessibility.

Follow Tailwind’s token system. Never guess styles.

Document your choices inside the code or via PR notes.

Always be thinking about how it will run on mobile.
